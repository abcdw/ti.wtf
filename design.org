* Design decisions
** get with query params instead of post
- it's easier to consturct a get query from any environment (browser, curl, http library)
- it's easier to cache the response of GET request (browser, load balancer, etc)
** sql database
- perfomance can be better for sql rather then crux
- easier to deploy on hosting provider like heroku or any other,
  because they have postgres deployment options
- more experience with sql
** TEXT vs VARCHAR
- According to [[https://www.depesz.com/2010/03/02/charx-vs-varcharx-vs-varchar-vs-text/][benchmark]] text with index works better than varchar in
  most cases
